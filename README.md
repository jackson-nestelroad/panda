# Panda
**Panda** is a command framework for building Discord bots on **[Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/)**. Panda provides a strongly-typed class-based structure for writing complex commands.


Panda provides a wide set of extendible classes for bots, commands, events, and services that allow anyone to rapidly spin up a complex Discord bot with a large set of commands. The primary motivation behind this command framework is the ability to handle chat (message) and slash (interaction) commands in the exact same way. Panda commands only require a single `run()` method for both. Panda takes care of all argument parsing behind the scenes, making complex commands much easier to implement.

A small example bot can be found in the [example folder](https://github.com/jackson-nestelroad/panda/tree/main/example).
